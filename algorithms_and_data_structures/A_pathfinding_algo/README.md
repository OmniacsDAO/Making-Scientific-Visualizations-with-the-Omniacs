# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

The A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm is one of the most efficient and widely used algorithms for finding the shortest path between two points. It combines the advantages of Dijkstra’s algorithm with a heuristic to estimate the remaining distance, allowing it to search faster and more effectively. 
A* is commonly used in game development, robotics, navigation systems, and artificial intelligence due to its ability to avoid obstacles and efficiently select optimal paths.

This folder contains a visualization that shows how A* explores a grid or map, prioritizing the most promising paths using both known and estimated distances. It’s a great learning resource for understanding informed search strategies.
