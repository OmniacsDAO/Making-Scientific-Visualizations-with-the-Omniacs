# Backtracking Algorithm

Backtracking is a general-purpose algorithm used to explore all possible solutions to a problem and backtrack when constraints are violated. It is key in solving puzzles, constraint satisfaction problems, and combinatorial challenges.

This folder includes examples and visualizations that demonstrate how backtracking explores and prunes the solution space.

Perfect for game development, robotics, logistics and learners exploring recursion, tree traversal, or solving problems like Sudoku, N-Queens, and mazes.
