# Circle-Line Intersection Animation

Understanding how lines and circles intersect is a key concept in geometry, physics simulations, and computer graphics. This visualization shows how and where lines cross circles.

In this folder, you'll find animations that illustrate the math behind intersection detection, such as solving quadratic equations to find points of contact.

Itâ€™s a valuable resource for learning computational geometry and visualizing abstract math in a tangible way.
