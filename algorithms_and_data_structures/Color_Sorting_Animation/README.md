# Color Sorting Animation

Color sorting organizes colors based on their properties—such as hue, brightness, or RGB values—to create smooth transitions or arrangements.

This folder contains an animation that sorts a palette of colors, illustrating the visual impact of sorting algorithms applied to color data.

Ideal for creative coders, designers, and anyone interested in the intersection of data science and aesthetics.
