# Connect The Dot

Connect the Dot is a technique that involves drawing connections between a set of discrete points based on a given rule or pattern. It is used in puzzles, graphic generation, and visualization systems to construct meaningful paths or shapes from data points.

This folder includes a visualization that demonstrates how to link dots based on proximity, order, or mathematical rules. It's a great tool for learning about coordinate geometry, graph theory, and how spatial data can be connected and interpreted visually.
