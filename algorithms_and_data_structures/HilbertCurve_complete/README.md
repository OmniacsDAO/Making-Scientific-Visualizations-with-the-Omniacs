# Hilbert Curve Visualization

The Hilbert Curve is a fractal and space-filling curve that maps one-dimensional data into two dimensions while preserving spatial locality. It’s useful in graphics, databases, and scientific computing.

This folder provides a complete visualization of the Hilbert Curve’s construction through recursion, showcasing its application in optimizing data access patterns.

Explore the visual to see how the curve fills space and preserves proximity in high-dimensional data.
