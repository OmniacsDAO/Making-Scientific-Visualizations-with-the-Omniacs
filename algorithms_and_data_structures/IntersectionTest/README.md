# Intersection Test

Intersection testing is used to determine if and where two or more geometric shapes—such as lines or circles—overlap. This concept is essential in computer graphics, physics simulations, gaming, and CAD tools.

This folder demonstrates how intersection logic works between lines and other shapes, showing both true and false intersections in visual form. It’s a foundation for more advanced applications like collision detection or graphical modeling.
