# Pathfinding Algorithms

This folder contains visualizations of multiple pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra, A*, BFS, and DFS. Each algorithm offers different strengths in finding paths through graphs or grids.

Explore how each one navigates space, handles obstacles, and prioritizes paths. Compare their behaviors and learn when to use each in real-world applications.

Perfect for learners interested in game development, robotics, or artificial intelligence.
