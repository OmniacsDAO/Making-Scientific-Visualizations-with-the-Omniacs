# Triangle Peg Game

The triangle peg game is a classic puzzle where pegs are removed by jumping over each other. The goal is typically to reduce the board to one remaining peg.

This folder includes a game logic simulator or animation that uses recursive backtracking to explore possible move sequences and find optimal solutions.

Itâ€™s a great example of logical reasoning, recursion, and strategy-based problem solving. Try it yourself and see how many pegs you can leave!
